  <h1>Solutions to Practice Problems with indexOf</h1>
  <p>All the solutions for this set of practice problems are displayed below. These solutions are for the problems in
    the "index.html" file.</p>
  <script>
    const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"];

    /*
    PROBLEM 1:
    Find the index of "banana" in the array "fruits" and log it to the console.
    */
    console.log(fruits.indexOf("banana")); // SOLUTION

    /*
    PROBLEM 2:
    Check if "fig" is in the array "fruits". If it is not present, log -1 to the console.
    */
    console.log(fruits.indexOf("fig")); // SOLUTION

    /*
    PROBLEM 3:
    Find the index of "cherry" in the array "fruits" and use slice to log an array of elements after "cherry", including "cherry".
    */
    const cherryIndex = fruits.indexOf("cherry");
    console.log(fruits.slice(cherryIndex)); // SOLUTION

    /*
    PROBLEM 4:
    Using indexOf, find the first occurrence of "date" in the array "fruits" and log an array that excludes this element and all elements before it.
    */
    const dateIndex = fruits.indexOf("date");
    console.log(fruits.slice(dateIndex + 1)); // SOLUTION

    /*
    PROBLEM 5 (DEBUGGING):
    The following code should log the index of "elderberry". Fix the error in the code.
    const searchFruit = "elderbery";
    console.log(fruits.indexOf(searchFruit));
    */
    const searchFruit = "elderberry"; // Corrected spelling
    console.log(fruits.indexOf(searchFruit)); // SOLUTION
