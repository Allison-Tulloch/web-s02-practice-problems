    /*
    PROBLEM 3: Create a variable called "kitchenItems" that holds an array of at least 5 kitchen items.  Using a "for..in" loop and concatenating strings, print out the following for each item: "I need to get a ______ at the store." (the blank should include a different item for each sentence)

Using a "for..in" loop and concatenating strings, print the index and value of each item in the following format: "Item Number __: ________" (first blank is index, second blank is todo item).
